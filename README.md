# Automobile-Car-Prediction-model-using-Linear-Regression
We are required to model the price of cars with the available independent variables. The management will use this model to understand exactly how the prices vary with the independent variables.

# Problem Statement
A Chinese automobile company, Geely Auto, aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts. 
They have contracted an automobile consulting company to understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting car pricing in the American market, as they may differ from the Chinese market.The company wants to know the following things:

* Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car?
* How well do those variables describe the price of a car?
Based on various market surveys, the consulting firm has gathered a large data set of different types of cars across the American market.  

# Navigation towards a solution
Leveraged Pandas Dataframe functions to drive out meaningful insights about the structure and Exploratory Data Analysis. Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries were exceptionally helpful in deriving the visualizations across the entire project. Finally, used the Statsmodel library to build a Linear Regression model and simultaneously improved it by the method of Recursive Feature Elimination. The model was evaluated with the help of Scikit Learn's metrics functionalities.
